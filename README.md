# CPU Emulator
As you know CPU has some basic instructions, like <b>START, STORE, LOAD, ADD, SUB</b> and etc.
You can execute some operations with these basic instructions. I wrote these instructions like methods for CPU Emulator.
And there are two example instruction sets in .txt files (sum.txt, matrix.txt)
<b>sum.txt</b> compute sum of number from 0 to 20.

<b>matrix.txt</b> print matrix indices to screen.

## Compile
```bash
javac Main.java
```
## Usage
For sum of numbers
```bash
java Main sum.txt
 ```        
For indices of matrix
```bash
java Main matrix.txt
```
