# CPU Emulator
As you know CPU has some basic instructions, like START, STORE, LOAD, ADD, SUB and etc.
You can execute some operations with these basic instructions. I wrote these instructions like methods for CPU Emulator.
And there are two example instruction sets in .txt files (sum.txt, matrix.txt)
sum.txt compute sum of number from 0 to 20.
<b> matrix.txt </b> print matrix indices to screen.


## Usage
For sum of numbers
```bash javac Main.java
        java Main sum.txt
 ```        
For indices of matrix
```bash javac Main.java
        java Main matrix.txt
```
